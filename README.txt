Notes on Folder Organization:
- Keep Components in their own subassembly folders
	- THE CURRENT FOLDER IS ONLY FOR THE TLA!!!
	- All other sub assemblies should be kept in their own folders (i.e. 'MEE', 'MRC', etc.)
		- To this effect all subsubassemblies, subsubsubassemblies, and so on should be 
		  in their own folders within a given folder.

- However: Keep all COTS (Commercial Off the Shelf) Parts in the COTS folder
	- There should be a subfolder within the COTS folder for each type of part
		- i.e. Screws, Nuts, Washers, Gears, etc.
	- COTS parts NEED to be named in plain english as well as include their part # somewhere
		- i.e. '#6-32 x 1" - [McMaster #]'

- Naming Schemes of other parts is less important, but:
	- Please name the assembly file(s) in the folder: _[Assembly Name]
		- This makes finding the assemblies much easier
	- Name your parts reasonable things
		- i.e. NOT 'Thing' or 'aslkfdj' or 'Doodly-Bob'

- Remember: this is a shared space, the cleaner and more consistent everyone leaves it, the more useful it will be
